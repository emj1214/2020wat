    <li class="about">
        "A tradition for more than 20 years, Walk-A-Thon is the only student-facilitated fundraiser at Marian. Each class competes against one another to raise the most money. Goals are determined by the number of students in each class. The event encourages the students to be advocates for Marian in helping to fund the costs that accompany the school’s operations.
    </li>

    <li class="about">
        "The classes are competitive and creative in the ways they raise funds. Not only do they ask for sponsorship from friends, family and neighbors, they also host bake sales, car washes, Go-Fund-Me pages and restaurant kickback nights. In addition, several local companies sponsored [previous years’] effort including: Mangia Italiana, Tussey’s Casual Grill, Mama’s Pizza, BHE Party Rentals and Ideal Pure Water.
    </li>

    <li class="about">
        "For their efforts, the students earned not only a significant contribution to their school but also a Halloween movie day, a week of free dress and a free day on Oct. 22."
